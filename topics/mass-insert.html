        <h1>Redis Mass Insertion</h1>
        
        <p>Sometimes Redis instances needs to be loaded with big amount of preexisting
        or user generated data in a short amount of time, so that millions of keys
        will be created as fast as possible.</p>
        
        <p>This is called a <em>mass insertion</em>, and the goal of this document is to
        provide information about how to feed Redis with data as fast as possible.</p>
        
        <h2>Use the protocol, Luke</h2>
        
        <p>Using a normal Redis client to perform mass insertion is not a good idea
        for a few reasons: the naive approach of sending one command after the other
        is slow because you have to pay for the round trip time for every command.
        It is possible to use pipelining, but for mass insertion of many records
        you need to write new commands while you read replies at the same time to
        make sure you are inserting as fast as possible.</p>
        
        <p>Only a small percentage of clients support non-blocking I/O, and not all the
        clients are able to parse the replies in an efficient way in order to maximize
        throughput. For all this reasons the preferred way to mass import data into
        Redis is to generate a text file containing the Redis protocol, in raw format,
        in order to call the commands needed to insert the required data.</p>
        
        <p>For instance if I need to generate a large data set where there are billions
        of keys in the form: `keyN -&gt; ValueN&#39; I will create a file containing the
        following commands in the Redis protocol format:</p>
        
        <pre><code>SET Key0 Value0&#x000A;SET Key1 Value1&#x000A;...&#x000A;SET KeyN ValueN&#x000A;</code></pre>
        
        <p>Once this file is created, the remaining action is to feed it to Redis
        as fast as possible. In the past the way to do this was to use the
        <code>netcat</code> with the following command:</p>
        
        <pre><code>(cat data.txt; sleep 10) | nc localhost 6379 &gt; /dev/null&#x000A;</code></pre>
        
        <p>However this is not a very reliable way to perform mass import because netcat
        does not really know when all the data was transferred and can&#39;t check for
        errors. In the unstable branch of Redis at github the <code>redis-cli</code> utility
        supports a new mode called <strong>pipe mode</strong> that was designed in order to perform
        mass insertion. (This feature will be available in a few days in Redis 2.6-RC4
         and in Redis 2.4.14).</p>
        
        <p>Using the pipe mode the command to run looks like the following:</p>
        
        <pre><code>cat data.txt | redis-cli --pipe&#x000A;</code></pre>
        
        <p>That will produce an output similar to this:</p>
        
        <pre><code>All data transferred. Waiting for the last reply...&#x000A;Last reply received from server.&#x000A;errors: 0, replies: 1000000&#x000A;</code></pre>
        
        <p>The redis-cli utility will also make sure to only redirect errors received
        from the Redis instance to the standard output.</p>
        
        <h2>Generating Redis Protocol</h2>
        
        <p>The Redis protocol is extremely simple to generate and parse, and is
        <a href="/topics/protocol.html">Documented here</a>. However in order to generate protocol for
        the goal of mass insertion you don&#39;t need to understand every detail of the
        protocol, but just that every command is represented in the following way:</p>
        
        <pre><code>*&lt;args&gt;&lt;cr&gt;&lt;lf&gt;&#x000A;$&lt;len&gt;&lt;cr&gt;&lt;lf&gt;&#x000A;&lt;arg0&gt;&lt;cr&gt;&lt;lf&gt;&#x000A;&lt;arg1&gt;&lt;cr&gt;&lt;lf&gt;&#x000A;...&#x000A;&lt;argN&gt;&lt;cr&gt;&lt;lf&gt;&#x000A;</code></pre>
        
        <p>Where <code>&lt;cr&gt;</code> means &quot;\r&quot; (or ASCII character 13) and <code>&lt;lf&gt;</code> means &quot;\n&quot; (or ASCII character 10).</p>
        
        <p>For instance the command <strong>SET key value</strong> is represented by the following protocol:</p>
        
        <pre><code>*3&lt;cr&gt;&lt;lf&gt;&#x000A;$3&lt;cr&gt;&lt;lf&gt;&#x000A;SET&lt;cr&gt;&lt;lf&gt;&#x000A;$3&lt;cr&gt;&lt;lf&gt;&#x000A;key&lt;cr&gt;&lt;lf&gt;&#x000A;$5&lt;cr&gt;&lt;lf&gt;&#x000A;value&lt;cr&gt;&lt;lf&gt;&#x000A;</code></pre>
        
        <p>Or represented as a quoted string:</p>
        
        <pre><code>&quot;*3\r\n$3\r\nSET\r\n$3\r\nkey\r\n$5\r\nvalue\r\n&quot;&#x000A;</code></pre>
        
        <p>The file you need to generate for mass insertion is just composed of commands
        represented in the above way, one after the other.</p>
        
        <p>The following Ruby function generates valid protocol:</p>
        
        <pre><code>def gen_redis_proto(*cmd)&#x000A;    proto = &quot;&quot;&#x000A;    proto &lt;&lt; &quot;*&quot;+cmd.length.to_s+&quot;\r\n&quot;&#x000A;    cmd.each{|arg|&#x000A;        proto &lt;&lt; &quot;$&quot;+arg.to_s.bytesize.to_s+&quot;\r\n&quot;&#x000A;        proto &lt;&lt; arg.to_s+&quot;\r\n&quot;&#x000A;    }&#x000A;    proto&#x000A;end&#x000A;&#x000A;puts gen_redis_proto(&quot;SET&quot;,&quot;mykey&quot;,&quot;Hello World!&quot;).inspect&#x000A;</code></pre>
        
        <p>Using the above function it is possible to easily generate the key value pairs
        in the above example, with this program:</p>
        
        <pre><code>(0...1000).each{|n|&#x000A;    STDOUT.write(gen_redis_proto(&quot;SET&quot;,&quot;Key#{n}&quot;,&quot;Value#{n}&quot;))&#x000A;}&#x000A;</code></pre>
        
        <p>We can run the program directly in pipe to redis-cli in order to perform our
        first mass import session.</p>
        
        <pre><code>$ ruby proto.rb | redis-cli --pipe&#x000A;All data transferred. Waiting for the last reply...&#x000A;Last reply received from server.&#x000A;errors: 0, replies: 1000&#x000A;</code></pre>
        
        <h2>How the pipe mode works under the hoods</h2>
        
        <p>The magic needed inside the pipe mode of redis-cli is to be as fast as netcat
        and still be able to understand when the last reply was sent by the server
        at the same time.</p>
        
        <p>This is obtained in the following way:</p>
        
        <ul>
        <li>redis-cli --pipe tries to send data as fast as possible to the server.</li>
        <li>At the same time it reads data when available, trying to parse it.</li>
        <li>Once there is no more data to read from stdin, it sends a special <strong>ECHO</strong> command with a random 20 bytes string: we are sure this is the latest command sent, and we are sure we can match the reply checking if we receive the same 20 bytes as a bulk reply.</li>
        <li>Once this special final command is sent, the code receiving replies starts to match replies with this 20 bytes. When the matching reply is reached it can exit with success.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>Using this trick we don&#39;t need to parse the protocol we send to the server in order to understand how many commands we are sending, but just the replies.</p>
        
        <p>However while parsing the replies we take a counter of all the replies parsed so that at the end we are able to tell the user the amount of commands transferred to the server by the mass insert session.</p>
